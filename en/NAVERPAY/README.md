## 1. Naver Pay (Standard)  

This is the latest Naver Pay payment service, where like other PGs, you can select Naver Pay as one of the payment methods from the checkout page. Unlike Naver Pay (Checkout), you can check payment status and information in real time. It supports both general and subscription/recurring payments.

i'mport Naver Pay integration is implemented based on payment integration guides in [Naver Pay Developers](https://developer.pay.naver.com/docs/v2/api). When you complete integration development, it must be reviewed by the Naver Pay code review team. You can request for a review application by contacting the i'mport technical support department (support@iamport.kr).
